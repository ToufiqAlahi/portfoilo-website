               <p id="padding-right"> I am a certified Google Ads individual. Since 2015 I’ve successfully built, optimized, and managed over hundreds of Google advertising campaigns. I have generated thousands of conventions, leads, phone calls with Google search and display ads, and increased sales and revenue with Google Shopping Ads. With the remarketing features, I have developed a lot of campaigns for brand awareness and remind audiences those who did not complete specific valuable action like the purchase or sign up for a newsletter, etc. </p>
